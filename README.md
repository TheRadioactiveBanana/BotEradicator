# BotEradicator
A simple and easy to use/setup, but very powerful Anti-Bot and Anti-DDoS Mindustry server plugin.
This plugin does not interfere with any other server plugins (most probably, if yours doesnt work with it please tell me).

# Commands
- botstatus - view status of the plugin and what bots banned from what ips.
- botconfig - configure the plugin. By default, settings are loaded to keep your server safe from 99%-100% of the bots.

# How to install
- Download the latest release from releases.
- Upload to your servers config/mods directory.
- Restart the server.
- configure it using the "botconfig" command.
- view what its doing using the "botstatus" command.
- AND FINALLY WATCH THE BOTS BURN IN HELL.

# Found a bug?
- Bother me on discord, and create an issue.
- Ill get to it as soon as possible.

# Have an improvement?
- Discuss with me on discord and maybe make a PR or something.

# If you want an IP removed from this list
- Don't even try unless its verified to not be a cloud IP.
- I don't want to waste my time removing random subnets that people own.
- It is not a "reputation issue", There are so many subnets here no one cares.
